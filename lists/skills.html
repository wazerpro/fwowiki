<h3><img width="32" height="32" src="./skills_files/skill_guard.gif">Guard</h3>

<p>This skill allows your character to help protect another PC, NPC or monster by absorbing some of the damage the protected target would normally takes, reducing the target’s damage level and prolonging its life. The skill can also be used during war events and Friendly Clan Versus Clan matches to reduce damage done to the objectives such as the skirmish monuments, town capture towers and the relic vault. To use the Guard Skill, the player must first select the target he wishes to protect and activate the guard skill. Each time a percentage of the damage is diverted from the guarded target and deducted from the guarding player’s Chi. The range of the guard skill, the amount of Chi cost for diverting the damage and the amount of damage diverted is dependent on the skill rank of the Guard Skill. The guard skill has a general cool down time of 6 seconds after it is deactivated before the next activation. </p>


<h3><img width="32" height="32" src="./skills_files/skill_id.gif">Identify</h3>

<p>This skill automatically identifies all items in your inventory. If the item's level is higher than the Identify Skill rank, the item cannot be identified.


</p><h3><img width="32" height="32" src="./skills_files/skill_pickpocket.gif">Pick Pocket</h3>

<p>With Pick Pocket, you can steal an item from the inventory of other PCs and NPCs. It only works if you and the target are both within combat range of each other. If either party moves out of the range, the attempt fails. Your character must remain still while activating this skill. If the attempt fails : </p>
<ul>
  <li> For an NPC - Target turns hostile and calls for the guards and allies to attack you. </li>
  <li> For a PC - The player gets a message revealing the identity of the thief. </li>
</ul>
<p>If the attempt is successful, the player who gets pick-pocketed will get a notification shortly after, without knowing the pickpocket's identity.</p>


<h3><img width="32" height="32" src="./skills_files/skill_prowl.gif">Prowl</h3>

<p>When activated, your character goes invisible and you can only move or turn at walking speed, evaluate other characters and NPCs and chat. Any other actions will immediately make you visible. If your invisible character receives any sort of damage, invisibility will be lost. Some NPCs, like guards, can detect an invisible character and deactivate your invisibility. Once the skill is activated, it will constantly drain your chi points until it is deactivated. The rank of the skill determines how long the character can remain invisible each time. Every 1 rank of the skill allows the character to stay invisible for 6 seconds. If there is insufficient chi to maintain, you will become visible again. This skill has a cool down time between usages. Detected characters cannot go back into prowl mode unless their Prowl attempt overcomes all the Detect Hidden skill used by other characters in the vicinity.</p>
  

<h3><img width="32" height="32" src="./skills_files/skill_res.gif">Resuscitate</h3>

<p>This skill allows your character to revive other fallen characters (HP reduced to 0), who will recover immediately. The resuscitated character will not lose experience points or gold penalty, unlike respawning. The targeted character has to accept the Resuscitate Offer in order to be resuscitated. The longer a character has been in a fallen state, the harder it is to resuscitate him/her. Therefore a higher skill rank is required to do the resuscitation. The resuscitator must spend chi points to activate this skill and every 1 rank entitles the character to revive a fallen character within 6 seconds. Revived characters will suffer Resurrection Sickness, the higher the rank the lower the Resurrection Sickness duration. </p>


<h3><img width="32" height="32" src="./skills_files/skill_sprint.gif">Sprint</h3>

<p>This skill allows you to run faster than normal. Movement speed is increased by 150% from normal running speed and whenever you add a skill rank, your movement speed will be increased by 1%. The skill continuously uses Chi points, and stops functioning when all Chi Points are used. This skill has a cool down time of 10 seconds after it is deactivated before the next activation. Whenever in sprint mode, your character is set to non-combat stance. Hence skills, power activation or transactions will be deactivated. Changing into combat mode automatically deactivates sprint mode. </p>


<h3><img width="32" height="32" src="./skills_files/skill_taunt.gif">Taunt</h3>

<p>This skill can only be used on NPCs or fighting monsters. It aggravates the NPC or monster and increasing the chance of attack on the player character that aggravates it. The taunt skill can be used in two ways, to lure an NPC or monster to a particular location to launch an ambush attack, or to distract an aggressive monster from attacking weaker members. Tanker type characters will use the taunt skill to make themselves the focus of the monster's attacks so that the rest of the party can do their part with less harassment. The taunt skill cannot be used against Player controlled characters or Game Object NPC such as merchants. The Taunt skill can only be used on NPCs or monsters that can fight. The range of the Taunt Skill is 30 meters. The taunt skill is not an area affecting effect and affects only 1 target selected by the user. It requires the user to select a target within range before activating the skill.</p>
